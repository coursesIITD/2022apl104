## Course Attendance
Students are highly encouraged to attend all classes. They have to attend the classes to receive 5% point attendance scores. In case of unavoidable absence, such as illness, job interview, please send an appropriate email with email subject specifying the subject code APL 104.

Again, students **do not have to** inform TA or instructor for their absent in the class. No matter the reason, students **cannot** get the point if they do not join the game during the class. Students can still get a full attendance mark although they miss one or two classes (games). Thus, we will **not arrange a special accommodation for the attendance.** Please do not send an email to the instructor or TA to explain your absent.

## Policy for Cheating 
<del>Students are encouraged to work in groups through collaborative learning only for homework assignments </del>. 

**This course has two full-time WEEF TAs. If you have a question, you need to visit the WEEF TA office to ask their helps. Also, you can use LEARN discussion board to ask questions. Do not discuss your homework to your colleagues before their submission.**  

Students are required to submit their assignments individually. The TA will run software to check your scripts to detect plagiarism. Please do not think that you are able to deceive TAs or instructor. Although you pass all the problems in the MATLAB Grader, you will get a 0 grade if your solution is considered plagiarism with a zero-tolerance. Also, you might be reported to Engineering Undergraduate Associate Dean as [**an academic offense**](#discipline). **Both copiers and copyees are guilty of cheating and will receive an equal penalty.** **The penalty includes a zero mark on the corresponding homework assignment or quiz and a zero mark on online engagement and pre-assessment.**

Experience has shown that the students who copy friend's solutions **do not know how to make them different** and tend to not bother to change their friends' code. **You should not trust your friends.** Once you share the solution with your friend, you will likely get caught for cheating. Sharing your solutions with your friend will not benefit you or your friends, and overall is a dumb thing to do. 

What's worse, once you are cheating, your and your friend's previous assignments and solutions for quizzes will be re-evaluated. If evidence is shown that solutions are shared among them more than one time, you will fail the course and should retake it in the future. Do not feel easy if your cheating is undetected as it can still end up in a disaster. **Please do not do anything you might regret.** 

Please review [**Policy 71 – Student Discipline**](https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71).
          
## Homework Assignment
The homework assignments will be designed using the MATLAB Grader. This tool allows students instant feedback on the correctness of their solutions through the pre-designed testers. Thus, students can be highly motivated and inspired to persevere with completing the assignments. Problems in the homework assignments are more challenging than examples or problems in the course materials. You might seek bits of help from your colleagues or TAs. 

You do not get used to writing your script directly to the MATLAB Grader only to pass the testers. For quizzes, students will only be able to submit their code on MATLAB Grader with a limited number. Thus, students are encouraged to use the MATLAB (program) editor to prepare the problems in the quizzes.  

There are 8 homework assignments. Each homework assignment have 2 points on a final grade and students can get the maximum 12 points from the homework assignment. This means students get a full mark (12 points) if they submit 6 homework assignments **on time**. **No late submission will be accepted for any reason.** **All delayed submission will be zero**. Although students are not able to submit the homeworks beyond their control (E.g., illness, job interview), **the instructor will not give any accommodation.** Thus, please do not waste your two chances for optional submission. Students do not ask TAs or instructor delayed submission. In case of significant health issues that stop from submitting more than two weeks, students should contact both the First-Year Engineering Office and the instructor and get a formal approval.   

TAs will not manually grade students' homework. If they pass all testers, they will get a full mark. All problems are equal weights. For example, students pass only 3 questions out of 6, students will get 1 point.  

Note that TAs will check the time records of the latest submitted solutions. Please do not revise (resubmit) your homework assignment after due date. This will be considered as delay submission.

## Communication  
**All communication will be made through LEARN but all information related to the course will be posted on this course website.** Students are responsible for checking the course website regularly. LEARN will be only used for announcements and online Q&A discussions.   

Students are invited to ask questions and answer them and share their knowledge and resources. Please direct your communications to the Discussion Forum on LEARN. However, if there is a good reason not to use the discussion forum (e.g., personal matters, a question that might reveal your solution of your report, etc.), please directly contact the TAs or instructor via MS Team.  

To encourage participation, when students ask at least one question each month in LEARN, they will receive **1 point of an engagement extra points each month**. Students will receive up to 4 points in total. **If the questions are trivial and easy to be answered from the course materials or lecture/tutorial videos, they will not be counted.** 

Please follow the instruction having Discussions on LEARN below:
- Please be respectful of your peers, instructor, and others in your posts and comments.
- **When you ask questions about tutorial problems, please indicate the problem number in the title. (e.g., M01001: YOUR TITLE)** 
- Asking good questions is another way of learning by summarizing and explaining what you know and do not know. Thoughtful questions and answers will help all students in this class. Before posting a question, please ask yourself whether you are truly stuck (meaning that the answers cannot be readily found on the web) and your questions are complete and legible.
- In addition, please check if the same question was asked before.  
- Inappropriate posts and comments will be immediately deleted and closed without notice.

Before you ask questions, please take a look at the following [**Q&A document**](qna) first. It is a compilation of frequently asked questions for each Module. You might find the answers to your questions!

In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>

### Grievance 
A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of his/her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/node/100">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>

### Discipline
A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for his/her actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/node/97">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/node/131">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>

If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>

### Turnitin.com
Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
